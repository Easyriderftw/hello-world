Starting repository

January 8, 2018
This is the beginning of my programming journey. I have started by utilizing a tutorial/guide from Javascriptissexy.com. The first leg of my endeavor has been to learn HTML & CSS through CodeAcademy. I have gone through the HTML course and completed it. I have also looked at videos on UDemy and have gone through some of their tutorials as well to supplement and improve upon the skills I learned through CodeAcademy. As a visual learner, I have picked up supplemental reading material/reference guide from the San Francisco Public Library. HTML5 in easysteps stood out to me because of the full illustarted diagrams throughout the book. I am an extremely visual and hands on learner, so this book has been great to clarify some questions I have had. I have also been keeping a digital log of my progress, which I will transition to Github to thoroughly document where I have started from and where I plan to progress to.
